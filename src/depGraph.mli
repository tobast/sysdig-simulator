(* DepGraph -- provides a way to handle and order topologically a list of
	net_list equations, as a DAG *)

type graph
exception Combinatory_loop


(***
 * Imports a graph from a Netlist_ast.program
 * from_ast : program -> programGraph
 ***)
val from_ast : Netlist_ast.program -> graph

(***
 * Creates a topologically ordered list from a graph, ie. you can process
 * the elements of the list in that order to compute the outputs
 * topological_list -> programGraph -> equation list
 ***)
val topological_list : graph -> Netlist_ast.equation list

(***
 * Debug function, displays the graph on stdout
 ***)
val dispGraph : graph -> unit
